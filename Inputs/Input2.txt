Avoid
Nov 2023 â€¢ Friends
Very disappointed. We were being told stories that didn't seem relevant to the location 
(it's central London for goodness sake, every ten metres is steeped in history, how hard 
can it be?). At one point we were stood outside a house that 'looked like' the haunted 
one being spoken about, not actually there. The talks were too long and if I'm being 
frank I lost track of what was being said most times. And don't be suckered by the 
boat part. It's a river taxi. So other members of the public are present and you don't
get ghost stories whilst you're on it either. Overall I have to say it wasn't remotely 
chilling or scary. Although he seemed nice enough chap, I would expect a certain level 
of performance from the host, which we sadly didn't get.
