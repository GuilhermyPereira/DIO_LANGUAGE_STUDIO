Must see if you're visiting Manhattan
Visiting the park was a true delight! We took an hour and a half tour provided by the Central 
Park Conservancy and it was excellent. We would have happily spent the entire day with our 
guide Desiree. The conservancy does a great job of maintaining the park. It definitely was
a highlight of our visit to Manhattan.
